## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm a DevOps Engineer and Cloud Consultant with a deep-seated passion for technology. My career began with hands-on roles, including computer repair, system administration, and network engineering. This strong technical foundation naturally evolved into a focus on cloud engineering. Over the past 8years, I have gained extensive experience in designing and automating resilient cloud infrastructures across leading platforms such as `AWS`, `Azure`, and `Google` Cloud
